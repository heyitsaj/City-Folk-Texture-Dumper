# Overview
This is just a project I've been working on to make it easier to dump the textures from City Folk for Dolphin without the tedious texture dumping process that is needed for many of them. Currently this only supports brres files for /npc/special, but more support is going to be added soon!
# How to use
1. Launch command prompt in the same folder as the script
2. Run `python .\TextureDumper.py` to launch
3. Follow the instructions in the menu

# TODO
  ‚úîÔ∏è Add basic support for some brres files\
  üî≤ Dump textures of all files in a folder\
  üî≤ Allow use for any brres file\
  üî≤ Allow use for bin files (specifically /npc/normal to get the villager textures) (This is super confusing for me and the documentation appears to be extremely limited, so I don't know if I'd be able to do it üò≠)

## Note: This is my first attempt at this type of project, so feel free to let me know if there are any issues, errors or optimizations I could make and I will do my best to fix them.
I'll continue working on this as often as I can until hopefully it can be a very useful tool for users to create custom texture packs for city folk. If you'd like to support me, feel free to do so on ko-fi, but really the thought of others finding what I make useful is all the support I really need. Enjoy! <3
