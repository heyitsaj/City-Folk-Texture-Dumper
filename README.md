# City Folk Texture Dumper
[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/M4M3W5Y93)\
 Dumps textures from Animal Crossing City Folk for Dolphin Texture Packs\

# Overview
 This is just a project I've been working on to make it easier to dump the textures from City Folk for Dolphin without the tedious texture dumping process that is needed for many of them. Currently this only supports brres files for /npc/special, but more support is going to be added soon!

# TODO:
  ✔️ Add basic support for some brres files\
  🔲 Dump textures of all files in a folder\
  🔲 Allow use for any brres file\
  🔲 Allow use for bin files (specifically /npc/normal to get the villager textures)\

## Note: I'm this is my first attempt at this type of project, so feel free to let me know if there are any issues
I'll continue working on this as often as I can until hopefully it can be a very useful tool for users to create custom texture packs for city folk.
